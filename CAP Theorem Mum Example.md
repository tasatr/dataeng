## Concistency

Asking mum or dad about something will always get the same answer

if they are in different rooms, they have to agree upon the answer, therefore cannot be alwats available 

## Partition Tolerance

If mum or data are not in the same room, I can still ask for help

## Availability

Whenever I ask for help, mum or dad will answer me

if they are in the same room, they can ear each other's answer and don't have to spend time agreeing upon things.
