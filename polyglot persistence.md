### Polyglot persistence

While this may not look as an "architectural pattern" as per the purists, keeping different types of persistence systems (SQL, NoSQL and NewSQL based) can help solve a data ingestion, processing and pipelining problem. Since different databases are designed to solve different class of "data problems", no single "database system" can solve upfront all the problems which "big data" platforms can have. In most cases, architecture evolves as business finds out what new types of data to capture and engineers figure out new ways of capturing it technically. One effective or "quick fix" way is to use polyglot persistence to capture different kinds of data and just "save" it for future usage. Capture whatever you can, however you can. The systems which do actual data processing and provide business insights can be built on top of this polyglot persistence layer at a later stage.
